# DirCopierApp

I wrote this application for about 3 hours because I needed to download a bunch of geographic data from public source http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/. I tried to use existing solutions like GNU wget for windows, but it was crashed several times after 10 minutes of downloading without any descriptive error. So this simple and small GUI application allows you to recursively copy files and folders from source path in your file system or any public URL to target folder in the file system.

Because I'm a developer myself I decided to spend some little time to create this application for myself to have flexibility and many ways to improve it for any additional tasks. But I think tasks like mine are obviously common, so I publish my code without any regulation or licensing. You can use it on your own like you want, copy, share, sell, anything. I will be glad for any pull request with improvements.
